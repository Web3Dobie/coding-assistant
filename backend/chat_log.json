    "assistant_reply": "That's great! Allowing multi-line input can significantly enhance usability and flexibility for your X-Agent project. If you'd like, I can help you adjust your code to handle multi-line input effectively. Here are a few considerations:\n\n### 1. **Input Handling**\n   Ensure your program can properly parse and process multi-line input. For example:\n   - If you're using a text box or textarea in a GUI, make sure it supports multi-line input.\n   - If you're working in a terminal, you might need to use a special delimiter (e.g., `Ctrl+D` or `Enter twice`) to indicate the end of input.\n\n### 2. **Data Processing**\n   Decide how you want to handle multi-line input:\n   - Treat it as a single block of text.\n   - Split it into individual lines for processing.\n\n### 3. **Code Example**\nHere\u2019s a simple Python example to handle multi-line input:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Enter your input (press Enter twice to finish):\")\n\n# Collect multi-line input\nuser_input = []\nwhile True:\n    line = input()\n    if line == \"\":\n        break\n    user_input.append(line)\n\n# Combine lines into a single string or process them individually\nmulti_line_text = \"\\n\".join(user_input)\nprint(\"\\nYou entered:\")\nprint(multi_line_text)\n```\n\n### 4. **GUI Example**\nIf you're working on a GUI (e.g., using Tkinter), you can use a `Text` widget for multi-line input:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef submit_text():\n    user_input = text_box.get(\"1.0\", tk.END).strip()\n    print(\"You entered:\")\n    print(user_input)\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Multi-line Input Example\")\n\ntext_box = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=40)\ntext_box.pack()\n\nsubmit_button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Submit\", command=submit_text)\nsubmit_button.pack()\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed or if you need help implementing this in your specific project!"
